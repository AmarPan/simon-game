## Description
This game is a recreation of the 90s children's favorite and classic of the same name by Milton-Bradley. 

The goal of the game is to press the colors in the exact same pattern and order as the computer, which gets longer and longer at each level.

## How to Win
A player wins by getting to the 7th level and successfully matching a computer-generated combination of 7 colors. However, the player may play on indefinitely well beyond this level.
